- **Model**: XGBoost trained on 100K+ financial transactions
- **Features**: 44 engineered features for comprehensive fraud analysis
- **Police Integration**: Specialized endpoints for case management and investigation workflows

### Frontend (React)
- **Framework**: React with Material-UI
- **Port**: 3000
- **Police Interface**: 
  - Case file upload and batch analysis
  - Individual transaction investigation
  - Investigation priority classification
  - Evidence report generation

### Machine Learning
- **Algorithm**: XGBoost Classifier optimized for fraud detection
- **Performance**: 99.96% AUC score
- **Training Data**: 100,000 realistic financial transactions
- **Risk Assessment**: Automated priority classification (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)

## 📊 Key Features for Police

### Investigation Tools
- **Case Priority Classification**: Automatic HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW priority assignment
- **Bulk Case Analysis**: Process multiple cases from bank reports or complaints
- **Individual Case Investigation**: Detailed analysis of single transactions
- **Evidence Documentation**: Structured reports for court proceedings

### Police-Specific Interface

- **Investigation Recommendations**: Specific action items for each risk level
- **Jurisdiction Integration**: Location-based case routing
- **Department Workflow**: Cyber Crime Division optimized interface

### Risk Assessment Categories
- **🔴 HIGH PRIORITY**: Immediate investigation required (>70% fraud probability)
- **🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Further verification needed (30-70% fraud probability)  
- **🟢 LOW PRIORITY**: Routine processing (<30% fraud probability)

## 🚀 Getting Started for Police Departments
